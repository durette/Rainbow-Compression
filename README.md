Try many 7-Zip settings to make the smallest possible archive.

Iterate over many possible configuration sets and create an archive with each configuration, then remove all but the smallest archive.

This is slow and uses a lot of disk space before it completes, but if you absolutely, positively must create the smallest file, this will accomplish it.

One use case is long-term archiving when using expensive cloud storage.
